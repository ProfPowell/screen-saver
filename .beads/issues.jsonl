{"id":"screen-saver-v07","title":"Optional text support with effect-specific requirements","description":"Effects should indicate whether they require text or not.\n\nCurrent behavior: All effects receive text, defaulting to 'Screen Saver' if slot is empty.\n\nDesired behavior:\n1. Each effect declares if it requires text (e.g., bounce3d needs text, starfield doesn't)\n2. If an effect requires text and none is provided, default to the site's domain name (window.location.hostname)\n3. If an effect doesn't require text, run without any text overlay\n\nImplementation:\n- Add static 'requiresText' property to Effect base class (default: true for backwards compatibility)\n- Effects like starfield, plasma, fireworks, tunnel can set requiresText = false\n- Update _getSlotText() in screen-saver.js to check effect's requiresText\n- If required and empty, use window.location.hostname as default\n- If not required and empty, pass null/empty to effect","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-19T20:02:24.365669-08:00","created_by":"tpowell","updated_at":"2026-01-19T20:11:28.873485-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T20:11:28.873485-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented optional text support.
